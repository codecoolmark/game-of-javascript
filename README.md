# Game of Javascript

The aim of this project is give students an introduction to javascript. The primary method by which they learn is playing the game. The primary interaction with the game is via writing javascript code. The main principle is that the students need to find out themselfs how to code but the game should offer interactive feedback about the code they write. Moreover at some point they should be introduced to the browser development tools and from then on can use any site as a resource to learn from including the game of javascript this means that all code (js, css, html) in this game should be excellent, simple, and easy to understand.

To sum the game should train the students in the following areas

* learn javascript and a bit of css and javascript,
* explorative learning (trial and error instead of reasoning and reading),
* deductive learning (learn from other code and examples).

To achieve these it is of paramount that the game

* is simple,
* the tasks are clearly defined,
* the tools that are used are as easy as possible.

This means for example we should rely as much as possible on integrated development and debugging tools of the browser and probably no nodejs and npm.
